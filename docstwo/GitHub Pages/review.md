# Collaborating: review online  
The GitHub flow allows us to propose and review changes in pull requests. To do so, you need to add collaborators who are granted push access to a shared repository. They create topic branches when changes need to be made. Pull requests initiate code review and general discussion about the changes before they are merged into the main branch.
