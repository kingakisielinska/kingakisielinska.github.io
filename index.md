# Introduction

This site is designed for educational purposes.  
It contains my notes from Technologies of Technical Communication classes,  a postgraduate studies at Vistula University.  

There is a search bar at the top of the page where you can type in a word of interest and search for it on this page.  

On the left side we have a navigation menu that contains sub-pages.

Below that is a table of contents of all the topics discussed.
